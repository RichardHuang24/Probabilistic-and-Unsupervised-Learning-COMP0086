# COMP0086 - Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning Coursework

This repository contains the code and written solutions for the summative assignment in the COMP0086 module at UCL. The coursework focuses on probabilistic models, unsupervised learning, EM algorithms, latent variable models, and probabilistic inference methods like Gibbs sampling and MCMC.

## üìò Overview

The assignment consists of multiple analytical and coding questions aimed at exploring key concepts in probabilistic machine learning. Topics range from modeling binary image data to implementing Expectation-Maximization and inference algorithms for real-world tasks.
